The Bring Your Own Data migration workshop is designed to leverage the expertise of an experienced Microsoft Cloud Solution Architect to help customers understand the changes and the efforts required to migrate their SQL Server databases to an Azure SQL Managed Instance (MI). A dedicated Cloud Solution Architect will instruct you over the course of two days to assess the current SQL Server, deploy the Azure SQL MI infrastructure, and migrate. After completing the workshop you will have the knowledge to assess, prepare infrastructure, and migrate your own SQL Server to Azure SQL MI.
